    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Last updated: March 30, 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      ToonVibes is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how
      we handle your data when you use our app to transform your photos into various artistic styles using AI technology.
    </p>

    <h2>Data We Access</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Camera:</strong> We request access to your camera to allow you to capture photos directly in the app.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Photos:</strong> We request access to your photo library to select photos for transformation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Image Data:</strong> We process the images you provide to create AI-generated artistic transformations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your photos are temporarily uploaded to our secure servers only for the purpose of generating artistic transformations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Image data is processed through multiple AI services (Replicate, OpenAI) to create the requested artistic styles.
      </li>
      <li>
        We do not store input photos permanently on our servers. They are deleted after processing is complete.
      </li>
      <li>
        Processed images are stored locally on your device using SwiftData for gallery management.
      </li>
      <li>
        All image processing is done through secure, encrypted connections.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Gemini:</strong> Used for AI-powered image transformations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>OpenAI:</strong> Used for additional AI processing capabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Replicate.com</strong> Used for specialized image processing features.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We do not retain input images beyond the processing period required to generate your transformations. Once the transformation is complete, the input image is immediately discarded. Processed images are stored locally on your device for gallery management.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can revoke camera or photo library access at any time through your device settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can disable notifications at any time through your device settings.

      <li>
        You can delete processed images from your gallery at any time.
      </li>
      <li>You can request information about your data by contacting us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new policy in the app.
