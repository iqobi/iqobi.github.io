  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Last updated: January 2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Avatar is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your data when you use our app
    to create stylized avatars from your contact photos.</p>

  <h2>Data We Access</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> We request access to your contacts to allow you to select which contact photos you
      want to transform.</li>
    <li><strong>Photos:</strong> We request access to your photo library to save generated avatars and access contact
      photos.</li>
    <li><strong>Face Data:</strong> We process the image you provide to create an AI-generated portrait in the selected
      style.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Contact photos are temporarily uploaded to our secure servers only for the purpose of generating stylized
      avatars.</li>
    <li>Face data is used solely to create a portrait that resembles the original image in the selected style. We do not
      use face data for any other purposes.</li>
    <li>Generated avatars can be saved back to your contacts or photo library, based on your preferences.</li>
    <li>We do not store your contacts or input photos permanently on our servers. They are deleted after up to 48 hours,
      and face data is not retained after processing.</li>
    <li>All image processing is done through secure, encrypted connections.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>revenuecat.com:</strong> Handles in-app purchases and subscriptions.</li>
    <li><strong>dzine.ai:</strong> Processes face data and input photos to create stylized avatars. The input image is
      not stored. Only the generated image is temporarily stored on the server for up to 48 hours.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Retention and Disclosure of Face Data</h2>
  <p>We do not retain input face data beyond the processing period required to generate your avatar. Once the portrait is
    generated, the input image is immediately discarded, and only the generated image is temporarily stored for up to
    48 hours to facilitate saving or further processing.</p>
  <p>Face data is shared only with our third-party partner, dzine.ai, for the purpose of generating the requested
    portrait. We do not disclose or share face data for any other purposes.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can revoke contact or photo access at any time through your device settings.</li>
    <li>You can delete generated avatars from your contacts or photo library at any time.</li>
    <li>You can request information about your data by contacting us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy in
    the app.</p>
