  <h1>Subscription Terms</h1>

  <p>Last updated: February 5th, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Free Trial</h2>
  <p>If you're offered a free trial, you can cancel at any time via your iOS settings. To avoid charges, cancellation must be done at least 24 hours before the trial ends. If not, the trial will automatically convert to a paid subscription. Any unused portion of the free trial is forfeited if you purchase a subscription during the trial.</p>

  <h2>2. Subscription</h2>
  <p>Subscription payments are charged to your iTunes account upon purchase and at each renewal. To prevent automatic renewal, cancel at least 24 hours before the current period ends.</p>

  <h2>3. Cancellation</h2>
  <p>To cancel a subscription purchased on the App Store, visit Apple Support <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223">https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223</a>.</p>
  <p>Note that deleting the app won't cancel the subscription. After cancellation, you'll continue to receive content for the rest of the current billing period without a refund.</p>

  <h2>4. Refund</h2>
  <p>Paid subscriptions are generally non-refundable. However, some App Store purchases may qualify for a refund, which you can request directly from Apple here: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223">https://support.apple.com/en-us/118223</a></p>

  <h2>5. Changes</h2>
